Ride for Life - motorbike ambulance service for pregnant mothers in rural Uganda.

#Problem
There are several problems:

Ugandan mothers being reluctant to access healthcare during pregnancy.  Some areas of Ugandan culture view pregnancy and childbirth as a matter for the woman to deal with privately.  This means some mothers put their health and the health of their child at risk because they are very reluctant to access health services during pregnancy and childbirth.
Lack of public transport in rural areas.  Mothers are not able to access health services because they have no transportation.
Lack of infrastructure in rural areas.  Of the mothers that do want to access health care, many rural areas do not have roads suitable for cars.
Clear demand for greater access to health services and information online, which is not available at the moment.  61.8% of people use the internet for seeking health information.  54.8% of those living in rural areas want information on their nearest health facility to be a priority for government information going online.
